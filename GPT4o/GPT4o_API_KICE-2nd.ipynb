            "   - **17th Century Changes:** The passage notes a shift in the 17th century with the influence of 실학 (practical learning), which introduced changes in the compilation and purpose of 유서. 실학자들 (practical scholars) aimed to reform reality and spread knowledge, incorporating new knowledge and showing flexibility in accepting non-주자학 (Neo-Confucianism) ideas.\n",

            "1. **Understanding the Criticism (㉯):** The criticism from '일부 주자학자' is that 이수광's work, which includes Western knowledge, is not purely aligned with 주자학 (Neo-Confucianism) and contains elements that are mixed and not focused on 심성 수양 (cultivation of the mind and character), which was a central theme in 주자학.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Analyzing 이수광's Approach:**\n",
            "   - 이수광 was open to incorporating knowledge beyond 주자학, including Western knowledge, which he encountered during his travels to China.\n",
            "   - He aimed to objectively introduce this knowledge, despite criticisms that it was not purely 주자학.\n",
            "   - His approach was to broaden the scope of knowledge and not be confined strictly to 주자학.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Evaluating the Choices:**\n",
            "   - **[1]** This choice emphasizes moral principles over personal gain, which aligns with traditional Confucian values but does not directly address the criticism of mixing non-주자학 elements.\n",
            "   - **[2]** This choice criticizes being confined to 주자학 and advocates for exploring various truths of the world, which directly counters the criticism of not sticking purely to 주자학.\n",
            "   - **[3]** This choice supports the idea of maintaining 주자학's prominence, which aligns more with the critics rather than countering them.\n",
            "   - **[4]** This choice warns against altering traditional texts, which again aligns with conservative views rather than countering them.\n",
            "   - **[5]** This choice emphasizes learning broadly from Confucian texts, which is more about deepening understanding within the traditional framework rather than countering the criticism of incorporating non-주자학 knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Conclusion:**\n",
            "   - The criticism 이수광 faced was about not adhering strictly to 주자학 and including other knowledge systems. The most fitting response would be one that defends the inclusion of diverse knowledge and criticizes the narrow focus on 주자학 alone.\n",
            "   - **Choice [2]** directly addresses this by stating that being confined to 주자학 and not exploring various truths is not the correct approach to learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the most appropriate statement by '이수광' to counter the criticism is:\n",

            "To address this question, we need to focus on the criticism mentioned in ㉯, which is \"일부 주자학자의 비판\" that claims 이수광's work is not pure due to the inclusion of non-주자학 elements. We need to find a statement by 이수광 that would counter this criticism by emphasizing the importance of being open to various kinds of knowledge, including those outside of 주자학. The statement should reflect 이수광's open-mindedness and willingness to incorporate diverse knowledge, as described in the passage.\n",

            "### Passage Analysis:\n",
            "1. **Uncertain Concepts in Law**: The passage explains that legal provisions often use uncertain concepts that require interpretation based on specific situations. This is true for both civil law and administrative law.\n",

            "2. **Civil Law Example**: \n",
            "   - If a predetermined amount for damages is excessively high, the court can reduce it. This is an example of discretion in determining the requirements and effects.\n",
            "   - **Liquidated Damages vs. Penalty**: \n",

            "     - If the nature of the penalty is not proven, it is treated as liquidated damages.\n",
            "     - If the penalty is proven to be a punitive penalty, the court cannot reduce it.\n",
            "\n",

            "   - Discretionary actions are those where the administrative body has the choice to determine the specific content of the administrative action.\n",
            "   - Discretionary rules are not laws, so not following them does not violate the law, but administrative bodies must adhere to the principle of equality.\n",

            "- **(가)**: No agreement on liquidated damages.\n",

            "### Choice Analysis:\n",
            "1. **[1]**: Incorrect. In (가), if 을's damage is not proven, 을 cannot receive any compensation since there's no agreement on liquidated damages.\n",
            "2. **[2]**: Incorrect. In (나), if 을's damage is proven to be 80, 을 can still receive 100 as liquidated damages, but the court can reduce it if deemed excessive.\n",
            "3. **[3]**: Correct. In (나), if the damage is not proven, 을 can receive 100 as liquidated damages, and the court can reduce it if deemed excessive.\n",
            "4. **[4]**: Incorrect. In (다), if 을's damage is proven to be 80, 을 can receive 100 as a penalty and an additional 80 for proven damages, totaling 180, but the court cannot reduce the penalty.\n",

            "1. **Energy and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):**\n",
            "   - BMR is a crucial part of metabolism, accounting for 60-75% of total energy expenditure.\n",
            "   - BMR can be measured directly or indirectly.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Historical Perspective:**\n",
            "   - Early studies suggested BMR is proportional to body surface area, which is related to body weight to the power of 0.67.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Kleiber's Law:**\n",
            "   - Kleiber found BMR is proportional to body weight to the power of 0.75, not 0.67.\n",
            "   - This was determined using an L-graph, where the logarithm of body weight and BMR were plotted, resulting in a linear relationship with a slope of 0.75.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **L-Graph and Relative Growth:**\n",
            "   - L-graphs help compare growth rates of two variables.\n",
            "   - If the slope of the line in an L-graph is less than 1, the growth rate of the variable on the y-axis (BMR) is less than that on the x-axis (body weight).\n",
            "   - If the slope is 1, both variables grow at the same rate.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Least Squares Method:**\n",
            "   - Used to find the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of squared deviations.\n",

            "### Analysis of Options:\n",
            "- **Option [1]:** If the slope is less than 1, it means the growth rate of ⓑ (large claw length) is less than ⓐ (carapace width). This does not mean ⓑ is not proportional to ⓐ; it just means the rate of increase is slower.\n",

In the passage, the Buddha indeed appears in Okyeong's dream and promises a child, which addresses the couple's concern about not having offspring. This aligns with the narrative structure mentioned in the additional information, where a mystical entity aids in resolving a problem. Therefore, this statement is appropriate.\n",

            "2. **Statement [2]:** It states that the 'red mark' on Mongseok's body serves as a unique proof that the prophecy about the 'boy child' has come true. The passage describes the prophecy of a special child with a unique mark, which is fulfilled when Mongseok is born with a red mark on his back. This fits the narrative device of using a unique sign to show the realization of a prophecy. Thus, this statement is appropriate.\n",

The passage indeed describes Choe Cheok's journey to different countries, including interactions with people of various nationalities, which aligns with the narrative technique of expanding the spatial background. Therefore, this statement is appropriate.\n",

            "4. **Statement [4]:** It claims that the 'sound of the flute' Okyeong hears acts as a catalyst for resolving the separation situation. The passage describes Okyeong recognizing the flute sound as reminiscent of her husband's, which leads to their reunion. This aligns with the narrative device of using a particular element to trigger problem resolution. Hence, this statement is appropriate.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Statement [5]:** It suggests that the couple's emotional reunion and the subsequent bleeding from their eyes represent both the joy of resolving a problem and the anxiety of facing a new one. The passage describes their intense emotional reunion, but the bleeding from their eyes is more a depiction of overwhelming emotion rather than indicating a new problem.

            "   - The tree is described as having grown significantly over the years, with its leaves becoming large and lush, symbolizing the passage of time and natural growth.\n",

This aligns with the discussion about highlighting significant features of the plants, such as conservation status.\n",

This suggests that additional information about the plants should be included.\n",

The description for ㉣ mentions several plants (가는마디꽃, 갈대, 각시수련) but states that there are no photos, only markings like dots and hatching. This indicates that photos should be added to align with the discussion.\n",
